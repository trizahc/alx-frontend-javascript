## Task 1: Teacher Interface

This task defines a TypeScript interface `Teacher` with required, optional, and flexible properties.

### Features:
- `firstName` and `lastName` are read-only.
- `fullTimeEmployee` and `location` are required.
- `yearsOfExperience` is optional.
- Additional dynamic properties like `contract` are allowed.

### Example:
```ts
const teacher3: Teacher = {
  firstName: 'John',
  fullTimeEmployee: false,
  lastName: 'Doe',
  location: 'London',
  contract: false,
};
## Task 3: Printing Teachers

- Created a function `printTeacher(firstName, lastName)` to return "F. LastName".
- Defined an interface `printTeacherFunction` for the function type.

### Example:
```ts
printTeacher("John", "Doe") // Output: "J. Doe"
